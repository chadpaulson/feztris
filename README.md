### Overview

Experiment / 3D puzzle game using a camera mechanic inspired by Fez.  The project started out as a Mac game intended for Ouya, GameStick, etc. When I play tested the initial game modes with a PlayStation 3 Dual Shock controller the game felt a bit clunky and I couldn't find a way to improve the experience.

I left the project alone until Unity's free mobile licensing announcement inspired me to give it one last shot on Android and iOS.  The mobile build is more fun, but I think I'm done with this concept and thought I would share.

Pardon the mess.


### How To Play

[![Feztris](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chadpaulson/feztris/master/feztris_demo.gif "Feztris running on iPhone Simulator")](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7X4KEylbpc)

Touch and [swipe similarly colored blocks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7X4KEylbpc) to match. A score multiplier kicks in when you match more than 3 blocks.  Swipe the sides of the screen to rotate the cube.


### Play The Game

An Android 2.3.3 (OpenGL ES 2) [APK is available](https://raw.github.com/chadpaulson/feztris/master/feztris-v0.1.apk). You can build the game for all platforms with Unity 4 and, if you are targeting iOS devices, a valid provisioning profile.  View the platform notes below for details.


### Platform Support

For those targeting Android and iOS, please build the latest commit.  For those targeting the latest stable version for Mac and PC, please build commit [c56e7a70d4](https://github.com/chadpaulson/feztris/commit/c56e7a70d4d7b3fb63244f460e725697e7a8e4ac).  Below is a breakdown of platform support.

### Motivation

An excuse to develop in Unity while exploring a half-baked concept.
